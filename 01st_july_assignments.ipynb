    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a structured approach to software development\n",
    "that focuses on organizing code into reusable, self-contained modules called objects.\n",
    "OOP aims to improve the efficiency, clarity, and maintainability of software by emphasizing the following key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: OOP promotes encapsulating data and related behavior within objects,\n",
    "allowing for better control and protection of data.\n",
    "Objects encapsulate data and expose methods or functions to interact with that data, hiding internal implementation details\n",
    "and providing a clear interface for other objects to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects,forming hierarchical relationships. \n",
    "It enables the creation of specialized classes (subclasses /child class) that inherit common attributes and methods from \n",
    "more general classes (superclasses/parent class).\n",
    "Inheritance promotes code reuse, as subclasses can extend or override inherited functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.\n",
    "It allows for more flexible and generic programming by providing the ability to write code that can operate on objects of different types.\n",
    "Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling them using classes and objects that\n",
    "represent real-world entities or concepts.\n",
    "It allows developers to focus on essential aspects while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "Abstraction helps in creating modular, maintainable code by providing clear interfaces and reducing dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these principles, OOP aims to enhance code reusability, promote modular design, improve code organization, and increase software development productivity.\n",

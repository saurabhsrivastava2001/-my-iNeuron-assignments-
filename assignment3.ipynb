    "ANSWER----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Code organization and reusability: Functions allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable units.\n",
    "Functions promote code reusability since you can call the same function multiple times in different parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Functions enable you to create abstractions by hiding the implementation details of a particular task. \n",
    "This abstraction allows you to focus on the high-level logic of your program without worrying about the specific implementation\n",
    "details of individual functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Code maintenance and debugging: With functions, if you encounter an issue or bug in your code,\n",
    "you can isolate the problematic function and debug it separately. \n",
    "This approach simplifies the debugging process, as you can focus on a specific part of the code rather than searching through the entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Readability and comprehension: Functions improve the readability of code by providing a way to encapsulate a specific task or behavior with a descriptive name.\n",
    "Well-designed functions with clear names and proper documentation can make the overall codebase more understandable\n",
    "and easier to comprehend for both the original developer and others who might work on the code in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are few important advantages of functions in a code.\n",
    "Incorporating functions into your programs can greatly enhance their structure, flexibility, and maintainability.\n",
